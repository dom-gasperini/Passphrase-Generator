# Passphrase-Generator
### By: Dominic Gasperini

## Description:
This is a simple GUI program for windows that allows the user to generate sets of random passphrases of varying complexity. Passphrases are a more secure and much easier to remember than the "typical" password! Although, it can be quite challenging to create a good random passphrase, that that's what this application does for you!
